		<p>Stanford has always stood out to me! With lively culture and rigorous courses, this incredible University has given birth to a majority of successful companies and business leaders! For example, LinkedIn (Co-founder: Reid Hoffman), Google(Alphabet) (Founders: Larry Page and Sergey Brin), SpaceX/Tesla (Graduate attendee: Elon Musk), and many more! As a high schooler interested in Astrophysics (further discussed in following sections), I aspire to change the world through technology and the utilization of our species interminable capabilities. Possibly expanding our reach beyond the moon.</p>
